## Thank You

The previous few months have truly been wonderful! Thanks to my amazing mentors' unending support, I had a lot of fun and learnt a lot throughout this period. I have become better at writing clean and maintainable code. I try to follow best standard practices.The EOS community's participation in Google Summer of Code was by far the finest experience. IÂ will continue to contribute to EOS.
